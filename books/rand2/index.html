The authors continue their investigations from Volume I [MR 92g:35059],
employing the same general principles. Further, they consider elliptic
boundary value problems the solutions of which are singularly perturbed
caused by several degenerations of the domain. This concerns, especially,
the following ones: (1) domains with narrow cavities, e.g., with tubes,
notches, or cracks removed; (2) domains consisting of some parts which are
connected merely by narrow passages; (3) narrow domains, i.e., the
expansions in some directions are very small compared with the other ones
(including, e.g., domains with closely neighbouring parallel cracks). Here
&quot;small&quot; or &quot;narrow&quot; is measured by a positive parameter <IMG WIDTH=3 HEIGHT=4 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3" SRC="img1.gif"> on which
the domain <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5" SRC="img2.gif"> in question depends; for <IMG WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=7 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline7" SRC="img3.gif">, <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5" SRC="img2.gif"> will degenerate: e.g., <IMG WIDTH=42 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline11" SRC="img4.gif"> with a
&quot;normal&quot; domain <I>G</I> in <IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=7 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline15" SRC="img5.gif">, and <IMG WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline17" SRC="img6.gif"> a torus of
thickness <IMG WIDTH=3 HEIGHT=4 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3" SRC="img1.gif">, will tend to <IMG WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline21" SRC="img7.gif"> where <I>M</I> is a closed
curve in <I>G</I>.
<P>
The main subject is the construction of asymptotic expansions, for
<IMG WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=7 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline7" SRC="img3.gif">, of the solutions of the problems posed in <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5" SRC="img2.gif">.
This is done, as in Volume I, by iteration processes which consist of
solving, in alternating fashion, certain limit problems (two, in general)
where at least one of them depends on parameters: one problem in <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline31" SRC="img8.gif">,
and another one, e.g., in the complement of the model of the cavity (hole)
removed from <I>G</I>. As usual in singular perturbation problems, boundary
layers may arise.
<P>
The proofs of solvability of the limit problems, and of the asymptotic
expansions of the solutions, rely essentially on results of the modern
theory of elliptic boundary value problems in piecewise smoothly bounded
domains. The constructions of the expansions here are mostly far more
complicated then in the cases of singular perturbations of local type
considered in Volume I. Fortunately, most problems are first presented in a
simpler model setting (e.g., Poisson's equation in <IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline35" SRC="img9.gif">).
<P>
In the last part (Chapter VII) of the book, asymptotic expansions of
solutions are, by similiar methods, constructed for elliptic boundary value
problems with rapidly periodically oscillating coefficients, but also for
differential or difference equations on <IMG WIDTH=3 HEIGHT=4 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3" SRC="img1.gif">-periodic curvilinear nets
in <IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=7 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline15" SRC="img5.gif">; especially, the corresponding homogenized differential
operators are derived.
<P>
Moreover, an interesting analysis of the paradoxa is given that may occur
with the solution of plane boundary value problems if a smooth boundary is
approximated by polygons.
