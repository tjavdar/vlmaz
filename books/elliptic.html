<P>"The authors have obtained many deep results for elliptic
boundary value problems in domains with singularities ...
without doubt, the book will be very interesting for many
mathematicians working with elliptic boundary problems in smooth
and nonsmooth domains, and it would be frequently used in any
mathematical library."

<P>This monograph systematically treats a theory of elliptic
boundary value problems in domains without singularities and in
domains with conical or cuspidal points. This exposition is
self-contained and a priori requires only basic knowledge of
functional analysis. Restricting to boundary value problems
formed by differential operators and avoiding the use of
pseudo-differential operators makes the book accessible for a
wider readership.</P>
<P>The authors concentrate on fundamental results of the theory:
estimates for solutions in different function spaces, the
Fredholm property of the operator of the boundary value problem,
regularity assertions and asymptotic formulas for the solutions
near singular points. A special feature of the book is that the
solutions of the boundary value problems are considered in
Sobolev spaces of both positive and negative orders. Results of
the general theory are illustrated by concrete examples. The
book may be used for courses in partial differential
equations.</P>
