<i>"This book presents a fascinating story of the long life and
great accomplishments of Jacques Hadamard (1865-1963), who was
once called "the living legend of mathematics". As one of the
last universal mathematicians, Hadamard's contributions to
mathematics are landmarks in various fields. His life is linked
with world history of the 20th century in a dramatic way. This
work provides an inspiring view of the development of various
branches of mathematics during the 19th and 20th centuries.</P>
<P>Part I of the book portrays Hadamard's family, childhood and
student years, scientific triumphs, and his personal life and
trials during the first two world wars. The story is told of his
involvement in the Dreyfus affair and his subsequent fight for
justice and human rights. Also recounted are Hadamard's
worldwide travels, his famous seminar, his passion for botany,
his home orchestra, where he played the violin with Einstein,
and his interest in the psychology of mathematical
creativity.</P>
<P>Hadamard's life is described in a readable and inviting way.
The authors humorously weave throughout his jokes and the myths
about him. They also movingly recount the tragic side of his
life. Stories about his relatives and friends, and old letters
and documents create an authentic and colorful picture. The book
contains over 300 photographs and illustrations.</P>
<P>Part II of the book includes a lucid overview of Hadamard's
enormous work, spanning over six decades. The authors do an
excellent job of connecting his results to current concerns.
While the book is accessible to beginners, it also provides rich
information of interest to experts."</i></P>
