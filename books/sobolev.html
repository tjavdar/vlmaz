Vladimir Maz'ya is one of the foremost authorities in the subject of
Sobolev spaces. However, many of his papers are published in Soviet
publications with very limited circulation. As a result he has
sometimes suffered the misfortune of seeing his results rediscovered or
attributed to others. With the appearance of the book under review
this state of affairs should belong to the past.

In the present book the author has collected and rewritten the results
of many years of research by himself and his collaborators. His has
added introductory material and results due to others, but most of the
contents of the book are due to the author himself. Naturally there is
a very little overlap with other existing books on Sobolev spaces.

Generally speaking, this book is not the right choice for someone who
is just trying to learn a few simple facts about Sobolev spaces. The
author's taste is for completeness. He treats every conceivable aspect
of his problems, which make the book rather overwhelming for the
general reader.

On the other hand, this makes the book all the more valuable as a work
of reference. It is a treasure house, for example, for someone who is
looking for a weird domain as a counterexample to some theorem, and
for many others. Every good library should have it.

<i>
The book is written for the expert, and a pretty determined one at
that. On first inspection it looks like a rather dreary catalogue of
hard technical facts. However the reader who is prepared to roll up
his sleeves and expend a lot of time and energy on mastering the
intricate analysis will be amply rewarded for the effort. For it is a
treasure-house of important results produced by a master of his
craft. It should best be thought of as an encyclopedia of results and
techniques. As such, it is to be recommended as an indispensable tool
for anyone with interests in function spaces, inequalities and
differential equations.
