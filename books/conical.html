<P>This book focuses on the analysis of eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions that describe singularities of solutions to
elliptic boundary value problems in domains with corners and
edges. The authors treat both classical problems of mathematical
physics and general elliptic boundary value problems.</P>
<P>The volume is divided into two parts: The first is devoted to
the power-logarithmic singularities of solutions to classical
boundary value problems of mathematical physics. The second
deals with similar singularities for higher order elliptic
equations and systems.</P>
<P>Chapter 1 collects basic facts concerning operator pencils
acting in a pair of Hilbert spaces. Related properties of
ordinary differential equations with constant operator
coefficients are discussed and connections with the theory of
general elliptic boundary value problems in domains with conic
vertices are outlined. New results are presented. Chapter 2
treats the Laplace operator as a starting point and a model for
the subsequent study of angular and conic singularities of
solutions. Chapter 3 considers the Dirichlet boundary condition
beginning with the plane case and turning to the space problems.
Chapter 4 investigates some mixed boundary conditions. The
Stokes system is discussed in Chapters 5 and 6, and Chapter 7
concludes with the Dirichlet problem for the polyharmonic
operator.</P>
<P>Chapter 8 studies the Dirichlet problem for general elliptic
differential equations of order $2m$ in an angle. In Chapter 9,
an asymptotic formula for the distribution of eigenvalues of
operator pencils corresponding to general elliptic boundary
value problems in an angle is obtained. Chapters 10 and 11
discuss the Dirichlet problem for elliptic systems of
differential equations of order $2$ in an $n$-dimensional cone.
Chapter 12 studies the Neumann problem for general elliptic
systems, in particular with eigenvalues of the corresponding
operator pencil in the strip $\mid {\Re} \lambda - m +
/2n \mid \leq 1/2$. It is shown that only integer numbers
contained in this strip are eigenvalues.</P>
<P>Applications are placed within chapter introductions and as
special sections at the end of chapters. Prerequisites include
standard PDE and functional analysis courses.</P>
